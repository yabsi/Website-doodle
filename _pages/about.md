I’m a software engineer who graduated from Iowa State University. I’m passionate about full stack development and have work experience in various positions. Currently I'm working a full time job at Structurely as a backend Engineer.

I was a teaching Assistant for CS 227 and a Community Advisor in Friley Hall for two years. I’m also an outgoing person who loves to code, work on his personal projects, travel, do competitive programming, and is a frequent participant at hackathons.
