What are your current short/long term goals? You may include your “ideal” career in engineering or your preferred working environment.

My short term goal is to be cross enrolled in my masters, doing a thesis in Computer Science and focusing on Algorithms or Data Structures. My long term goals involve getting a job at a good company, which means self-directed teams and an environment that allows continuous improvement.

Reflection:
======
Some of those classes eased my transition into college, which had been a drastic one, by making me understand some of the changes that will happen in college. I also think that most of the classes have taught me to structure and organize my thought and definitely kept me well-rounded; no matter which industry or country I end up in, I believe I developed some balance to help me adjust because of those classes.

I think that going through all those problem solving classes makes us forget the importance of other important skills, like communication and analyzing information. Whenever you're solving an engineering problem you have to be able to communicate clearly and analyze whatever information you have.
Having a different context also caused me to develop ideas of how products might be able to solve a problem that people might not realize they could have a solution for. Those classes will also help you put context to those problems.
