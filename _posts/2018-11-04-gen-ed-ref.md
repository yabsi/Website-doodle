GE1: What are your current short/long term goals? You may include your “ideal” career in engineering or your preferred working environment.
GE2:  What  have  you  learned  in  your  general  education  electives,  which  allow  you  to  formulate  and evaluate  engineering  solutions  in  problem  solving  and  innovation  beyond  the  technical  aspects  in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an engineering problem?
GE3: Relate what you have learned in general education classes to seeing beyond the engineering solution in problem solving and innovation. What are some other dimensions to consider and what impact do they have in an economic, global or societal context
