This project was assigned to students in CS227 in the fall of 2019. I made the GUI.

This is slow because it is an attempt to run a JAR file in the browser using CheerpJ. You can download the Jar directly instead here:

<div class="w3-twothird" align="center">
  <script>
      cheerpjInit();
      cheerpjCreateDisplay(700,750);
      cheerpjRunJar("/app/files/spaceInvaders.jar");
  </script>
</div>
