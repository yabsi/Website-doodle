For my senior design project, we were presented with the issue of the lack of a TPM in Android devices and figure out a solution to somehow "simulate it". 
Working under Professor Akhilesh Tyagi and graduate student Timothy M. Dee, we based our solution on this paper:

A PUF(Physical Unclonable Function) is a device that lets you exploit manufacturing randomness to generate a "digital fingerprint". In the case of 
this project, it was based on the silicon foundry process transistor-level variability embedded in the touchscreen grid of a smartphone(Nexus 7 was used for testing). 
We were able to develop a mobile application that uses a PUF that asks the user to draw a shape a few times to create a user profile and authenticate against that profile in the future. 
It proves to be unique and reproducable respectively, by exhibiting the physical unclonable function (PUF) properties: 
  - Touchscreen gestures are quantized into binary strings.
  - Gesture hamming distance is 60+ bits for 128-bit strings for different user-device profiles; it is 0 bits for the same profile.

By having the key generate dynamically, that means that it is not stored on the device and that solves the issue of the lack of a TPM.
