My Ethics Reflection:


"Write an essay on ethics of reusing the same academic project/work for credit in 2 different places. For software, usually software reuse is a good thing. Think of an instance where software reuse (you are the author) may create ethical dilemmas in a realistic work environment."


Self-plagiarism is defined as the reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work. There's multiple reasons why this is wrong and I'll explore them in academia then industry.

Submitting the same work for two classes violates different assumptions of the teachers giving the assignments:
1. Expecting unique coursework For Individual classes.
2. Expecting the assignment to advance the student's growth and learning.
Furthermore, any work you do in the present is, most likely, going to be different than what you've done in the past and by not redoing the work, you're hindering yourself from advancement. It also becomes an issue of integrity when you reuse an assignment while everyone else spends time working on it.

Now, where does this become an issue in industry?
1. It's illegal, most companies will have you sign an IP, you're getting paid to write code for that one company.
2. Unless the code is open source, you should not keep any copies of it
3. The code might even be a core piece in the company and reusing it will be giving other companies advantages. You can reuse your ideas but not your code(unless it's open source!);
